#problem 1:

Generate ploblem 1 data by executing python problem1_generate_data.py. This will create three files in the local directory: 1. calculated_potential.txt, 2. dx_potential_data.txt, 3. dy_potential_data.txt as well as print out the answers to part B. i)

To generate the plot for part A of problem 1, execute python plot_problem1_partA.py in the same directory the calculated_potential.txt file is located. This will generate a countour plot of the potential. 

To generate the plot for part B of problem 1, execute python plot_problem1_partB.py in the same directory the dx_potential_data.txt and dy_potential_data.txt files are located. This will generate a (probably incorrect) visualization of the electric field. 


#problem 2:

run the file Problem2.py by executing python Problem2.py. This will generate a graph of f(x) as well as the analytical derivative f'(x). It will calculate these functions coarsely and finley over the specified interval, as well as calculate the interpolant of the fine data. I could not figure out how to plot this interpolant correctly, so it is not represented in the plot.
